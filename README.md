kivy-grid-cells
===============

This is a prototype Kivy application that allows a grid of a certain size to be
created. This grid's cells may then be switched on or off by clicking them.

To run the prototype:

1. Install the requirements. These are currently Kivy and Numpy.
2. `python main.py`

See the [Kivy documentation](http://kivy.org/docs) for more.
